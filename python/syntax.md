# Python

Python is an interpreted programming language available on most operating
systems and processor types.

```python
print("hello world")
```

Above is a simple python program that prints out to the screen the text "hello
world". In this program the word `print` is followed by a `(` and the line is
completed with a `)`. That is the form taken to show that `print` is a function,
the arguments to which lie between the two brackets.
