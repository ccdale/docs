## Integers

An integer is a whole number without a fractional part. 2, 234, 70689 are all
examples of integers.

23.754 is a floating point number as it has a fractional part, so therefore it
is not an integer.

## Integer Division and Mod

Integer division is the process whereby you can calculate the number of times
one integer is contained in another.  The result is always an integer, the
remainder is thrown away. 7 / 2 = 3 is an example the remainder of 1 is thrown
away.

Mod is the process of calculating the remainder part of an integer division. It
is usually denoted with the percent symbol.  Using the integer division example
above: 7 % 2 = 1.
